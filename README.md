# ChatApp Deployment with Terraform

This repository contains Terraform configuration files for provisioning the necessary infrastructure for deploying a ready-made ChatApp. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to use Terraform for automating the deployment of cloud resources and networking components to host the ChatApp.

## Overview

These Terraform files define the resources needed to deploy a ChatApp, including virtual machines, databases, networking, and other essential cloud resources. The scripts aim to provide a seamless and repeatable process for provisioning infrastructure in a cloud environment.

### Features:
- Provision cloud resources for ChatApp deployment
- Fully automated infrastructure setup using Terraform
- Can be customized for different cloud providers

## Getting Started

To use this repository and deploy the resources, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites:
1. **Terraform**: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
2. **Cloud Provider Account**: You'll need an aws account.
3. **Terraform Provider Configuration**: Ensure you have configured your AWS credentials properly.

### Steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatapp-deployment-terraform.git
   cd chatapp-deployment-terraform

2. Configure the Terraform provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.) in the main.tf file (depending on your cloud provider).

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init

4. Review the plan to see what will be created:
   ```bash
   terraform plan

5. Apply the configuration to create the resources:
   ```bash
   terraform apply

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to confirm and deploy the resources.

### Customization:
You can modify the Terraform configuration files to suit your needs. For example, adjust instance sizes, database configurations, or add additional resources.
Make sure to update any environment-specific variables, like cloud credentials or region settings.

### Clean Up
To destroy the provisioned resources and avoid ongoing charges, run:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
This will remove all the resources that were created by Terraform.
